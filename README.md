# My Project

This repository contains a web project built with **Vite**.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite** â€“ build tool for fast development
- **HTML / SCSS / JavaScript**
- [Optional: any other libraries you used, e.g., Axios, Swiper]

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```
2. Navigate to the project folder:  
```bash
cd your-repo
```
3. Install dependencies:  
```bash
npm install
```
4. Start the development server:  
```bash
npm run dev
```
5. Open your browser at the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`)

## Future Improvements

If I had more time, I would improve the project by:

1. Better **form validation** with highlighted invalid fields.  
2. Animations for elements appearing on scroll.  
3. Implementing an **SVG sprite** for icons.  
4. A JavaScript function to properly insert images in the hero section in **JPEG/WebP** formats.  
5. More detailed use of **ARIA attributes** for accessibility.  
6. Improving the **product section**:  
   - Better ARIA attributes  
   - Support for **WebP and JPEG images**  
   - Separate files for small preview images (88x88)  
7. Adding **different images for different screen sizes** to improve performance (responsive images)
